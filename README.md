# SpigotWget
**SpigotWget** is a simple tool allowing you to **upload a file** directly to a Spigot server **from its URL**. This is particularly useful in the case of **remote servers**, avoiding the need to download the file to your PC and then transfer it by FTP for example.

## How to use it
The plugin **simply adds** the ```/wget``` command to your server. This command can only be used by an **OP player** or **from the console**.

### Usage example
Here are the details of how to use this command:
 1. **Find** the URL of the file that you want to download.
 2. **Type** ```/wget <url>``` and wait for the end of the process.
 3. **Go** to the displayed directory to find your file.
 4. **Move it** to the wanted path and you're done!
